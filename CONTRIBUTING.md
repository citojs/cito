# 🔍&nbsp; Debugging the application
> **Warning**
> The support is experimental with Vite. The Source map generation is not at a comfortable level. The experience is not good. We'll continue to work towards a solid ground with the debug experience.

[VS Code debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging) is
setup to work in Edge, Chrome and FireFox, when the development server is running
press F5 to launch one of them up!

# 👹&nbsp; Troubleshooting Guide
> **Note**
> If any problem is not listed and a solution is found for it. Please add it here. It could save us a lot of our time in the future! 🙌

This section contains a list of common problems developers have experienced with this repo, hopefully you'll never need to go through this but it might be the reason you're reading this!

## On Windows - "The term 'pnpm' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program"
A common trait is that the pnpm binary is not added to Path Environment Variable. Could be a result of a broken Node.js installation or that some Path Environment Variable has been tinkled with manually or by other programs.
#### _Solutions_
- Try Reinstalling Node.js. _If that does not work go with next list item._
- Read more about Path Environment Variables with this [search](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=how+to+add+custom+path+to+windows&t=brave&ia=web).
